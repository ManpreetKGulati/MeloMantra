Spotify Developer Account:
In light of our team members' existing Spotify developer accounts, we proceeded directly to creating a new application within the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

App Created

 
Once the app is created, copied the Client ID and Client Secret, which is used for calling the Spotify API and is confidential.




The JavaScript code is designed to fetch and display data from the Spotify API, specifically focusing on music genres and playlists. 

Client ID and Client Secret:
•	The clientId and clientSecret variables store the credentials required for authentication when making requests to the Spotify API.
